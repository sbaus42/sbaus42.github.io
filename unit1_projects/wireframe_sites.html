			<h3>
				Hipmunk
			</h3>
			
			<p class="indented">Hipmunk makes the list as my favorite website because it has a simple design without disregarding the importance of the service they're performing. It is extremely straightfoward. It knows the reason you're visiting the site and it pretty much takes your hand, and guide you to flight scheduling heaven. Once you navigate into the site, your attention is immediately captured by the box in the middle. Here is were all of the interaction happens, whether you're looking for a hotel or a flight. The search is very simple and the loading screen is very "cute". When the results are loaded it is very easy to understand the returned information and sort it according to ones needs.</p>
			<p class="indented"> This website is extremely useful because it eliminates the need of a travel gaency at the time of searching for a convenient and cheap flight. One of the many features that I liked the most was the fact that it does not force you log in to be able to use it. To the date I've use this website about 4 times to purchase an air plane ticket and I still haven't had the need to log in. It is definitely in the best interest of any website to have numerous users, but Hipmunk does not force you or coerce you into becoming a member. </p>
			<p class="indented"> I think the site is very clean and simple, I truly believe navigating through this site is the easiest thing that can be done other than performing a basic search in google. It is very intuitive and the design makes me wish every airline would follow suit.</p>

			<h3>Twitch</h3>

		
			<p class="indented">Twitch is my second favorite website and it made the list mostly on the basis of the amount of times I visit it. I do watch a lot of the different games being streamed here or even leave it as a background noise when I'm doing something else. The video box immediately catches your attention to what seems to be the channel with the greatest amount of views. Under the video box you get the option to cycle through other channels that are also popular and most of the time are streaming content from different games. I believe this is a very nice feature because it is giving the site variety. Under this general box you find a list of games in order of active viewers. This makes it easy to cycle through all the different games and select the one you wish to follow. Clicking on the game brings you to a another screen where you see all the channels again ordered by active viewers.
			</p>
			<p class="indented">The site has a lot of content, many boxes that show all the different games and channels. It amazes me greatly that regardless of this, the site a no point feel like it's cluttered. I can easily navigate to other channels and other games without the need of many clicks. </p>
			<p class="indented">Again, this is a website that does not require you to log in for viewing, but if you want the extra features such as chatting and streaming you will eventually need to sign up. That is hardly an issue since the process can be completed with the use of Facebook and even if that method is not preferred, the sign up process is very simple. </p>
			<p class="indented">This is one of those sites I can waste away many hours. It is however very easy to be self concious of the time spent because the videos are streamed and you feel the flow of time whenever you need to pause. This happens because unpausing doesn't resume at the stopping point but rather it goes to wherever the streamer has taken you. It is entirely understandable this is the case since keeping track and storing video data would put a great deal of strain in the servers.</p>
			<p class="indented">The site doesn't really sell anything but they offer you the capability of streaming, which I've used to showcase games to my friends and chat with them while I'm playing a game they are yet to buy. It is a very fun site and I do enjoy most of the time spent in it. </p>

			<h3>Mangastream</h3>

			<p class="indented">Mangastream is a website I visit every Wednesday to watch my weekly manga episodes. The moment you surf into this site your eyes are diverted to the blog post written by god-knows-who. I'm not a particular fan of that blog post but it gives you something to skim through while selecting what Manga to read (A Manga is a comic). The Manga options are listed on the right in what I believe is the form of a list/table and only the most recent episodes are shown in this list.</p>
			<p class="indented"> The design is very simple and uncluttered so it feel very comfortable to navigate. Even though the only real navigation that happens is switching the pages of a selected Manga. </p>
			<p class="indented">This site makes japanese comics available to our side of the world. The quality of translation seems to be good and the scanned copy from the books are also very good. There are many other sites that have Manga comics but the reason for this one to be superior in my opinion is because it doesn't take me more than 10 minutes to interact fully with the site (I just read 2 comics). Such is the nature of the interaction because the site is very practical and it targets an large audience.</p>
			<p class="indented">I don't spend a great deal of time in this site because I don't have the need to but if I had to I don't think I'd feel better or worse.</p>
