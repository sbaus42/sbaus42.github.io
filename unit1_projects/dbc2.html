		<h3>The Grip</h3>

		<p>To hold the racquet correctly, you must make sure that the grip is the same as if you were picking up from the floor. It should look something like this once you're grasping it:</p>

		<h3>The Footing and the Swing</h3>
		<p>For the most part you want to reach the ball in a very comfortable position. You'll want to be sideways so you can twist your torso while hitting the ball for an increased range of motion. For the swing, you want to make sure you are winding the racquet before the ball has arrived but not before your opponent has hit the ball.
		<p>Again, you want it to look something like this:</p>

		<h3>Follow Through</h3>
		<p>After making contact with the ball you have to make sure the racquet follows it course. This is important for the trajectory of the ball as weird as it may sound. It will also determine the type of hit you're performing (more on that later). Once again, the motion should end like as in the following image:</p>

		<h3>Full Motion</h3>
		<p>Now that you know the very BASICS, this is what a full motion would look like in a perfect world. Click on the image to follow a video link.</p>
