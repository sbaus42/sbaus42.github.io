		<h3>Two type of elements</h3>
		<p>For the purpose of explaining this concept, we're only interested in looking at two types of HTML elements. Inline and block elements to be more precise. Explaining these before going into the details of what displaying them mean will be key to a clear understanding</p>
		<p>Block elements are those elements which start and end with a new line. You easily identify them because using one of these will separate you 'block' of text from any preceding or following elements. Another quality of block elements is that they will take the full width available to them</p>
		<p>On the other hand there are the inline elements. These elements are somewhat the opposite of blocks because they do not force line breaks and they only use as much width as is necessary.</p>
		<h3>What is a display in CSS?</h3>
		<p>A display is a property that will define how an element will be shown as part of a webpage. This seems as a very standard definition but it will help us understand in the next few lines a lot better.</p>
		<h3>How does it all come together?</h3>
		<p>An inline block will keep the properties of a block in the sense that it will still have block qualities but it won't break the line in which it resides. This means that you can have a small box in the middle of a paragraph withouth starting a new line. </p>
		<div>So far theres has been a lot of text so allow me to include some images of both code and how it would look to drive my point a bit better.</div>
		<h3>Inline example:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Emf0B.png"></li>
			<li>
		</ul>
		<img src=""> <img src="">
