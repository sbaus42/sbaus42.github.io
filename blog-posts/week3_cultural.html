			<h3>My thinking Style is: crazy!</h3>
			<p class="indented">
				Ok, so as a brief opener I'd have to say that I tied in Abstract for both ordering abilities... I guess the abstraction part makes perfect sense for me because I tend to wander off quite a lot when I'm understanding new concepts. Whenever I'm reading something new, I start to think of the what ifs and how tos. I think it's a cool quality to have but it tends to hurt me some times because I don't finish the initial exploration. Once I think I know a bit of what is being explained, I try to jump right into some applicability of it. For the most part I end up flopping because I haven't finished reading or having something explained when my mind just started to wander off.
			</p>

			<p class="indented">
				Now, what doesn't make sense is that I had both sequential and random show up. When reading over this  <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">link</a>, it made little to no sense that sequential had show up. Especially given the information I just provided in the previous paragraph. The only sensical explanation for this could be that I do appreciate that way of thinking quite a lot. I've always wished to be very organized in general, maybe that desire was projected into the test and it got reflected in my results.
				<br> When there's a will, there's a way, so I hope I can start organizing my thoughts during DBC and make sure my brain molds a bit better into that sequential ordering of thoughts. This doesn't mean I don't appreciate my randomness (We can call it crazyness), but I'd like to really be able to think in both ways if possible.
			</p>
			<h3>Issues and planning for them</h3>
			<p class="indented">
				My single biggest issue has been dealing with CSS. 
				<br>It's not an impossible concept for me to understand. It is quite the opposite, I understand it but I'm bad at being good at it. If that doesn't make any sense let me try to explain:
				<br>During the first and second week I tried to make my page as nice as possible with the few concepts I had gone through. I read about elements and divs and so on, and how CSS would allow me to work wonders with it by adding some logic to their classes or IDs. In theory, I understood everything. Practice was a cruel teacher that was lecturing me on how little I actually understood. To tie this into my randomicity in terms of ordering ability, you have to understand that the momment I understand one concept, I'd jump into sublime and try something new without finishing whatever text I was reading.
				<br>To fix this, my plan is to actually force myself to sit down and READ through the whole thing. Only once I'm done it is when I will allow myself or my mind to start prancing arround. I won't forgo the randomness, it just that I will make a good space for it in the learning process.
				<br>This also ties in to my visual and kino learning styles. Again, they are tied for first place with a total of 8. It again makes perfect sense because I need to live through the experience to internalize new concepts. This is probably why I'm pretty good at sports that require you to develop hard skills. I'm not very good at endurance sports.
			</p>
			<h3>Growing the mind</h3>
			<p class="indented">
				Changing a mind set must definitely be a challenge. It is part of the growth mind set to take challenges head on and persevere at them. That is why I plan to suck it up, endure and embrace that sequential thinking.
