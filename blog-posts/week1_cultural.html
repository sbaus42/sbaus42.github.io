				My impressions of DBC... in short, I think I'll love it here. Going through the video made me realize even more that I did take the right decision. I liked hearing how the first courses were a lot like a family (not that we won't be.. right?) and they helped around to clean the place and the kitchen and so on. I think that may have been something that brought the people together even more along this path of knowledge. I also liked the fact that he is letting us know that yes, we did pay for something but that the sense of entitlement that should come out of this "Purchase" should not be towards the classes or how professors must be taking good care of our learning, but rather how we should feel entitled to ourselves and our hunger for knowledge.

				I think and hope the people selected by the admissions group are awesome. Not awesome programmers, but awesome people in general with drive. I say this because I also hope to be awesome along everyone that will be my classmate. I think the culture will embrace everyone, even more if we're working hard because seeing the guy/girl next to us going through this torture (in the sense of work intensity) will more than likely fuel us to work even harder. Hopefully that will create a work hard infinite loop :).

				My expectations have not really changed but I'd rather say they have been solidified. I always "knew" we were going to be working very hard, but it's like... if there was a train in the distance and I was in the middle of the tracks just looking at it coming. It's in the distance but it's coming faster and faster as is the realization that this IS going to be very hard work. Week 1 helped see it in that way and to further progress the metaphor, we need to grab a hold of that train instead of jumping out of its way(In my metaphor world you can grab the train without being run over).

				The type of learning explained by Shareef is the only way of learning I really believe in. It is the only thing that makes sense to me because we're not good at learning. I think I read somewhere that humans in general are really bad at learning. It takes repetition for us to drill down a concept most of the time. Yes, there are some boy/girl-wonders around, but they're just outliers. That same repetition I'm talking about shouldn't come from only reading books over and over again but by doing, or at least that is what I believe. You will never find a professional Tennis player that got to that level by sheer talent, practice by doing is how he/she did it.

				The idea of going through this camp makes me extremely nervous. Not because I'm afraid the curriculum will be to hard, or because I didn't know if the people are going to be nice (which at this moment I know they're all pretty cool) but because this is one of those few opportunities in life where I have been able to challenge myself and have an outcome that will impact my professional life at the same time.
