				Keep in mind that javascript has been around for 19 years. That is a lot of time, and it wasn't as popular back then as it is now. Why is it so good now? What are the great things about this language? What are it's limitation?
				<br>I will attempt to answer these questions in the following paragraphs	
			</p>
			<h3>So... what's great about it?</h3>
			<p class="indented">
				Javascript is a dynamic programming language that makes the website in which it is used to be dynamic. What does this mean?
				<br> If you think about those annoying box fields that ask you to create a password with a set of conditions and that don't allow you to keep on going filling those fun forms. That is javascript making that web site form both annoying and dynamic. It is making the website force you to place some input in that field with a set of conditions that can be set on the client side. The webpage is not going back to the server and asking "Hey bro, this guy just gave us a password, is this password cool with you?". Instead, the webpage is being smart about it and thinking 'the programmer told me I shouldn't accept this stuff, I'll annoy the user until he gives me what I want'.
				<br>That dynamic aspect of javascript alone takes a huge strain from the server and that is why people like javascript so much. With the advent of faster computer, there are more complex functions and dynamic capabilities that don't rely on the server any more but on the client.
			</p>
			<h3>Where does it fall short?</h3>
			<p class="indented">
				From what I've researched, here is a list of things it can't do:
				<ul>
					<li>JavaScript cannot write to files on the server without the help of a server side script</li>
					<li>JavaScript cannot read from or write to files in the client</li>
					<li>JavaScript cannot close a window if it didn't open it</li>
					<li>JavaScript cannot access web pages hosted on another domain</li>
					<li>JavaScript cannot protect your page source or images</li>
				</ul></p>

			<p class = "indented">
				They hardly mean anything to me at these point but I think, I'd at least list them here. There must be more things javascript can't do, but the merits and it's growth has stemmed from what it can so I'll be glad to focus on that for the time being.
